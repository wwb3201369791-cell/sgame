# Core Refactor Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the refactor core implementation.

Planned modules:

- `driver_service`
- `process_service`
- `game_service`
- `overlay_service`
- `control_service`
- `main` (CLI + bootstrap)

For now, the launcher can start the legacy core binary path configured in `refactor/conf/user.env`.
